[ ] mixed strategies
[ ] mutation
[ ] crossover
- depends on how 'different' parents are
- 'different' : L2 distance or L1 distance

linear prgramming for strategies we have co-evolved (100 x 100)

genetic algorithm on the mixed strategies

What I have:
1. Co-evolved strategies - (?) steady state
- can i get a steady state

-> if so we can use thesee strategies over a sample of 100 samples to linear program

-> if not then change magnitude of mutation
Because strategies are really common as a result of crossover of the 14 best of each set, each set of generations pinpoints a good weighting of troops that beats a similar weighting of troops -> this gives hope that we have cyclic behavior in the strategies since it turns out weighting is great on two big battlefields.

I will run evolutions over many generations to see if such a pattern exists.

bascially what strategy beats ur strategy is the next generations -> graphic to see pattern?

2. Mixed Strategies -> from co-evolved strategies

measure comparing two strategies
if a beats b and how far apart they are
