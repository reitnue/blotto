Notes

Tried crossing and doing the rounding, ended up with a pretty steady state.

Agent A's strategies dominated all of Agent B's strategies.

-> Need to have a good mutation function

Strategies after 10 iterations are all the same -> sign that mutation isn't doing enough or that crossing is too much. Im probably crossing strategies too much, because i only work with the top 15 and they are likely very similar.

- better mutation
- better crossing - randomly choosing parents.
