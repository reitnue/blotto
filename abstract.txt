First I intend to build a framework to run Blotto games as well as incorporating data from FiveThirtyEight. Then I will start running genetic algorithms on existing strategies using strategies from FiveThirtyEight as a benchmark or source of strategies for mutations. Then using the results I will construct a mixed strategy agent as demonstrated in a paper by Tofias (2007), where we evolve players against a self-evolving player and then estimate probability distributions of strategies to determine mixed-strategy profiles. Then use the mixed-strategy agent to see its performance against a non-zero sum version of Blotto.
